*** The posts this generates to the Facebook page is only available for show on my personal accounts. I believe this is due to the fact that the Facebook app is not live. However it will still work and generate a proper response. It is stil a fullstack app that goes from the front end, to the backend, to my Facebook page. I will try and fix this as soon as possible. Sorry. ***
